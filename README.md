As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is project one of the program. This project is a blog I created using a Github blog template created by user chabaldwin. The blog discusses the dataset I selected from Kaggle that shows Real Estate Data for NYC Property Sales across the 5 boroughs over a year. The project involves using the CRISP-DM process to answer 3 business questions about the data.

The template for creating this blog in Github can be found here: https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/generate
