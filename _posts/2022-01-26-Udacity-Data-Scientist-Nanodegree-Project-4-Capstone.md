## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: Project 4 Final Capstone Project

As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is final Capstone project or project four of the program. 

I have not yet selected the actual project but it will involve:

- Research and investigation of a real-world problem of interest
- Accurate application of specific data science algorithms and techniques
- Proper analysis and visualizations of data and results for validity
- Documentation and write-up of a report of the work
