## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: Project 3

As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is project three of the program.

This project involves Recommendation Engines. These are the algorithms used to make suggestions or recommend things to you based on past purchases or usage, or based on what other users are buying or downloading. For example, think of early Point of Sales systems that would tell cashiers to make suggestive sales like "if they are purchasing nails suggest a new hammer as well." Nowadays, apps like Netflix have these Recommendation Engines in place that suggest movies to you that might also enjoy based on what you have been streaming or enjoying in the past or based on what is most popular with other users.

This project involves analyzing the interactions users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform and making recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. This will be accomplished by creating a Recommendation Engine that employs a number of the techniques taught in this program. We will use existing data that gives us usage history to create a Matrix Factorization technique called Funk SVD or Simon Funk's Singular Value Decomposition method which allows for incomplete or missing data points as well as predicting the effectiveness of our model, rank-based (top ratings by all, most liked by all, etc.), knowledge-based (adding filters where the user can help us pinpoint their preferences like publication year, subject matter, genre, etc.), and collaborative filtering (match to what other similar users liked).
