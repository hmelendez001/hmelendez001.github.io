I want to share with you my experience of working through the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree online program as well as where I am taking my career over the next few months.

I have an electrical engineering degree from Swarthmore College and I am starting on my Computer Science Master's Degree in the spring of 2022 from a university to be named. I am currently a Senior Director of Design and Data at RSM, a middle market tax accounting firm.

I plan to blog about my experience in completing my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree, the effort and time involved, as well as the projects I completed.
