## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: Project 2

As part of my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program, my second project involved the development of a web application displaying a Disaster Response Pipeline, showcasing the following Data Science and Software Engineering Best Practices:

* Github and Code Quality including this repository along with comments, docstring, and unit tests
* ETL or Extract Transform Load data setup of a clean dataset
* Machine Learning including NLP techniques to process text data and the proper use of pipelines and grid search, traning vs. test data, and model evaluation
* Deployment of our web application showing our Disaster Response Pipeline visualizations
