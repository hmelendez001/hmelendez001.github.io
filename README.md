As part of the udacity.com Data Scientist nanodegree, this is a blog to document my experience with the program. This project was created using a GitHub template created by user chabaldwin. The blog discusses the 4 different projects starting with a dataset I selected from Kaggle that shows Real Estate Data for NYC Property Sales across the 5 boroughs over a year.

The template for creating this blog in GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/chadbaldwin/simple-blog-bootstrap/generate
The instructions for creating this can be found here: https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html
