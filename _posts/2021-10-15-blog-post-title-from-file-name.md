## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree: Project 1

Project 1 of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree program involves a CRISP-DM analysis of NYC Real Estate Data I found on Kaggle.com that involves sales of properties during a one-year period across the five boroughs of New York City.

I will attempt to answer the following 3 questions:

1. Question 1?
2. Question 2?
3. Question 3?

### The analysis as described in my Jupyter Notebook

#### Some Python Code

```python
# Show data types
df.dtypes

# Only 'object' categorical columns
cat_df = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).copy()
```

#### Some PowerShell Code

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a powershell Code block";

# There are many other languages you can use, but the style has to be loaded first

ForEach ($thing in $things) {
    Write-Output "It highlights it using the GitHub style"
}
```
